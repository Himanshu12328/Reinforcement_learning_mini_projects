# Reinforcement_learning_mini_projects
This repository contains four projects demonstrating proficiency in various Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

## Projects
### Continuous Grasping with DQN: 
Designed an accurate Deep Q-Learning network that used continuous visual feedback to learn effective grasping of regular objects.

### Breakout with DQN: 
Successfully implemented DQN to play Breakout and achieved a mean score of 127 points, showcasing a strong grasp of reinforcement learning fundamentals and their practical applications.

### Policy and Value Iteration: 
Demonstrated proficiency in policy iteration and value iteration by implementing them for Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym.

### Model-Free Algorithms: 
Implemented two effective model-free algorithms, including first-visit Monte-Carlo(MC) for on-policy prediction and control for blackjack and Temporal-Difference(TD) for cliff walking.


Each folder has its own README.md file with further details about the project and how to run the code.
